issues with design

usb port not far enough

header ports not spaced like arduino

some of the oled screens i have have vcc and ground flipped, some dont.

leds not going all the way down. probably because holes are too big and too far apart...

colors of led when i do by hsv doesnt match expectations. tbd, test RGB. So it seems need to add as RGB to get that working...
CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];
FastLED.addLeds<WS2812B, LED_PIN, RGB>(leds, NUM_LEDS)
