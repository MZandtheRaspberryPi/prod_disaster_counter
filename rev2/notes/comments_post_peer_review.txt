put a 0.1 uF capacitator as close to attiny as possible
a cap of 0.1uF is sufficient by each led. if problems can upgrade to 2.2.
when desoldering use temp of heatgun of 360 degrees, ours wont get that hot
could consider adding a zener diode to the input to protect against overvoltage
add a 10k resistor betwen reset of attiny to 5v so that it is always high.
add capacitors for oled. 0.1 and 2.2 uF for stability.
ground plane on the top and bottom. then could do star or whatever power distribution.
dont put 5v trace by data trce. min distance is 3x thickness between the two layers.
